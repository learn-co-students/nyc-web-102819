### What I Should Take Away From My Time With Sinatra

1. MVC patterns
2. RESTful routing
3. Using Params
4. How to build forms

### Deliverables

> * create all 7 RESTful routes and the corresponding views
> * create full CRUD functionality for a single model
> * implement a one-to-many association using ActiveRecord 
> * build associations using form elements
> * investigatin how the params hash gets built




### Discussion Questions

1. What are the 7 RESTful routes and their views?
2. How is the params hash built?
3. What do we use the `seeds.rb` file for?
